Algorithms in JavaScript

All js files need to be tested in node environment, so we use
Karma & jasmine for functional testing. No grunt, no travis, we just
need to manually test all files at once whenever we changed the code.

Download the zip file and decompress it to your local file system
like /work/aj/, the "cd /work/aj/", execute "karma start" to see the
result of tests.
